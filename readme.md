This is to be a sort of text adventure game... Maybe a Twine game or just vanilla JS.

It's called Dear Hunter, which of course is a play on Deer Hunter... but in it you're composing a letter to a guy named Hunter.

Keeping it simple.

You pick lines for several sentences, then a closing, and finally a signature from multiple choices.

Then, you send the letter off, and you get one back from Hunter that you can read.

Each choice has a counter-part/analog in the letter you get back in reply.

That's it!
